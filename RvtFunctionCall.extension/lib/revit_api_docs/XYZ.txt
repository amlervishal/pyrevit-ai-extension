# XYZ

The XYZ class represents a point or vector in 3D space.

## Properties
- `X`: Gets the X-coordinate.
- `Y`: Gets the Y-coordinate.
- `Z`: Gets the Z-coordinate.
- `IsZeroLength()`: Gets whether the vector is of zero length.
- `IsUnitLength()`: Gets whether the vector is of unit length.

## Methods
- `Add(XYZ)`: Adds two vectors.
- `Subtract(XYZ)`: Subtracts a vector from this vector.
- `CrossProduct(XYZ)`: Computes the cross product with another vector.
- `DotProduct(XYZ)`: Computes the dot product with another vector.
- `Normalize()`: Normalizes the vector to unit length.
- `DistanceTo(XYZ)`: Computes the distance to another point.
